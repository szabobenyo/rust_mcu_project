To run the program:
- You need two terminal windows to see clearly the magic.
I call them as terminal_one and terminal_two.
So, when your code is ready, type into terminal_one:
    - cargo build --target thumbv6m-none-eabi
Meanwhile, open the gateway at terminal_two with the command:
    - openocd -s C:\share\scripts -f interface/stlink.cfg -f target/stm32l0.cfg
Okay, back to terminal_one:
    - cargo run (if you have a well configured openocd.gbd file, you have nothing more to do)*
Monitor the data received from the device on terminal_two.

To stop/terminate your program, just use the combination of CTRL + C.
Type 'q' on terminal_one if it's needed. Then CTRL + C

*Important commands flash due to (if you don't have a well configured openocd.gdb file).
- openocd -s C:\share\scripts -f interface/stlink.cfg -f target/stm32l0.cfg
- arm-none-eabi-gdb -q -ex "target extended-remote :3333" target\thumbv6m-none-eabi\debug\rust_mcu_project
- monitor arm semihosting enable
- load
- continue
