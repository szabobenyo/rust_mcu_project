To run the program:
- You need two terminal window to see clearly the magic.
Call them as terminal_one and terminal_two.
So, when your code is ready, type into terminal_one:
    - cargo build --target thumbv6m-none-eabi
Meanwhile, open the gateway at terminal_two with the command:
    - openocd -f interface/stlink.cfg -f target/stm32l0.cfg
Okay, back to terminal_one:
    - cargo run (if you have a well configured openocd.gbd file, you have nothing more to do)
Monitor the data received from the device on terminal_two.

To stop/terminate your program, just use the combination of CTRL + C.
Type 'q' on terminal_one if it's needed. Then CTRL + C
